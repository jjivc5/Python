We use a little horizontal sign called a **hyphen** ("-") to combine an adjective and verb when they come **before** a noun.  
  
If they come **after** the noun, there is no hyphen.

|---|---|
|I hate **slow-paced** horror movies.|This film is **slow paced**.|
|She thinks it's a **well-made** series.|She thinks that the series is **well made**

If something happens "**out of the blue**", it happens very unexpectedly.  
  
This originally came from the phrase "like a bolt out of the blue", meaning that on a blue-sky day ☀️ you wouldn't expect a lightning bolt! ⚡

**Direct speech** is a person's original words, while **indirect speech** reports what someone has said.

When we want to report somebody's original words we:  
👉🏽 change future and present forms to past forms. 🔙  
👉🏽 change past forms to past perfect. 🔙 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Direct speech|Indirect speech|
|"I **will never star** in a rom-com."|She said she **would never star** in a rom-com.|
|"I'**m** on the cover of the magazine."|She announced that she **was** on the cover of the magazine.|
|"We**'re shooting** a film."|She said that they **were shooting** a film.|
|"I'**ve broken up** with my girlfriend."|He said he **had broken up** with his girlfriend.|
|"I **was only talking** to him, we're not a couple."|He said he **had only been talking** to him.|
|"The director personally **chose** the cast."|They said the director **had** personally **chosen** the cast.|

In some situations, we **don't need to change the verb form** when we use indirect speech.  
  
For example: 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|👉 when we report something immediately after it happens and it's still true|What did she just say? She said she's going home.|
|👉 when we report a general truth|The teacher said that wolves live in packs.|
|👉 after verbs and verbal phrases that don't have past forms such as "might", "would", "should", "had better", "used to", "could", "mustn't"|The actor said he would never audition for this role.|

The title of this article is a pun (a play on words with a double meaning). 😮

The title of this article is **a pun** (a play on words with double meaning).  
  
_**Thorny case**_ is a phrasal verb (adjective + noun) describing a complicated or difficult situation, much like the one in this story!  
  
However, this phrase also has a literal meaning based on the context of this article: "thorny" relates to sharpness (in this case the needles) and "case" can mean a container, like the punnets (boxes) of strawberries.  
  
So, the news title refers to both "a difficult situation" and "a punnet of sharp objects".
