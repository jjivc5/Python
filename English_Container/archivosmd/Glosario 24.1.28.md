Look at some examples of how we can talk about the future:

| Verbal time  | Sentence  | What kind of plan it is  |
|---|---|---|
|**Future simple**|"I'll start my new book next week."|_A plan for the future._|
|**Present continuous**|"I'm cooking dinner this evening."|_A plan for the near future._|
|**Future continuous**|"At 9pm tomorrow I'll be driving to the station."|_Something that will be happening at a certain point in the future._|

**By this time next year, I'll have completed my studies.** : El a√±o que viene a estas alturas habr√© terminado mis estudios.

---

We use the future perfect to talk about an action that is expected or planned to happen **before a certain point in the future**. üîÆ

|  Sentence |  Explanitation  |
|---|---|
|By this time next year, **I'll have completed** my studies.|_I will finish my studies before this time next year._|
|**My boyfriend will have met** my entire family by Christmas.|_My boyfriend will meet my entire family before Christmas._|

---

### How do we form the future perfect?

We form it using "**will have**" (‚ûï) or "**won't have**" (‚ûñ) + **past participle**. We also need to indicate a **specific time** ("by next year", "by tomorrow" etc).

| Sentence  | |
|---|---|
|I hope that by this time next year, I **will have bought** a car.| |
|They **won't have finished** the project by next Monday.| |

Here's a reminder of when we use the **future perfect**.

|By this time next week **I will have moved** house.|_I will move house at some point before this time next week._|
|The new apartments **won't have gone up** by October.|_The new apartments won't go up at some point before October._|

**By this time next week, you will have finished your exams!** : La semana que viene, a estas alturas, habr√°s terminado tus ex√°menes.

**I won't have eaten by the time you get back.** : No habr√© comido para cuando vuelvas.
