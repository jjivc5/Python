**The causative** : El causante.

**Breakdown services** : Servicios de averÃ­a. Asistencia en carretera.

| Have  | Get   |
|---|---|
|"I had my car serviced."|"I **got** my car serviced."|
|"He's having his hair cut."|"He'**s getting** his hair cut."|

**I need to get my eyes tested.** : Necesito revisarme la vista.

In this lesson, we'll learn two new causative structures used to mention **who** does the action â€“ "**have somebody do something**" and "**get somebody to do something**"  
  
But first, we're going to listen to a conversation between two friends Clara and Joel. Here is some vocabulary that will help you understand them a little better.

- **a bad hair day** (n) â€“ Â a day when you don't feel attractive and everything goes wrong
- **yikes** (exclamation) â€“ an informal way to show that you're surprised, worried or shocked
- **freaking** (adj) â€“ an informal way to intensify what is being said

---

If you want to mention **who** **does an action** for you because you instruct them or ask them to, use "**have somebody do something**".Â 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|"Have" is the verb that changes its form.|"I **had** the waiter bring the menu."|
|The verb describing the action is in its basic form.|"She had the children **clean** their room."|

---

You can use "**get somebody to do something**" instead of "**have somebody do something**".

- I **had** my mum **cut** my hair.
- I **got** my mum **to** **cut** my hair.


**Assistant** : Asistente.

|**have/get something done**|**have somebody do something**  <br>**get somebody to do something**|
|---|---|
|the focus is on the action|the focus is on the person|
|"I had my nails done."|"I got my sister to do my nails."|

We use "if" and the _past simple_ ("were") to introduce a **hypothetical situation**, but you can either use:  
  
1. "would/could/might" and the _infinitive_ ("be") to refer to a **present consequence**  
or  
2. "would/could/might" and the _present perfect_ (_"_have been") to refer to a **past consequence** (which is one type of mixed conditional).

|   |   |
|---|---|
|a **present** consequence (_2nd conditional_)|a **past** consequence (_mixed conditional_)|
|"If he weren't already married, I **would be** his wife now."|"If he weren't already married, I **would** **have married** him."

You've just learned one way to create a mixed conditional sentence! ðŸ˜ƒ  
  
Next we'll look at how to mix up the 3rd (past) conditional! ðŸ¥„  
  
**Did you know?** ðŸ’¡  
You can change the order of the two parts of the sentence and write the consequence **before** the situation. Look at these examples. ðŸ‘‡

- **I would have married him myself**, if he weren't already married.
- **I'd (I would) be rich** if I had a dollar for every time I heard that.

---

The rules are generally similar to the first type of mixed conditional, but do note the differences in verb tenses!  
  
We use "if" and the _past perfect_ ("had been") to introduce a **past situation**, but you can either use:  
  
1. "would/could/might" and the _present perfect_ ("have been") to refer to a **past consequence**  
or  
2. "would/could/might" and the infinitive ("be") to refer to a **present consequence** (which is another type of mixed conditional).

|   |   |
|---|---|
|a **past** consequence (_3rd conditional_)|a **present** consequence (_mixed conditional_)|
|If we had left earlier, we **would have** **been** on time.|If we had left earlier, we **would be** at the party now.|
