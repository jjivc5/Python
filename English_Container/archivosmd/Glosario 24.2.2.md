In this lesson, we'll learn how to **add more information** about the way something is done - this could be its time, place, frequency or even your opinion on it!  
  
This kind of information can be added using **adverbs** (one word, often finishing in "-ly") and **adverbial phrases** (more than one word).

|**Adverb**|**Adverbial phrase**|
|---|---|
|She speaks **quickly**.|He asks me questions **all the time**.|

**Once upon a time** : √ârase una vez.

**Muttered** : Murmur√≥.

**His first sip** : Su primer sorbo.

**Widely** : Ampliamente.

**Desperately** : Desesperadamente.

When you want to add **more information** about **when** something happened, **how** it happened or **what you thought** of it, use adverbs and adverbial phrases.  
  
Feel free to start with the ones you've just learned.

| The thing   | The Verb |
|---|---|
|how something happened|"**comfortably**", "**quickly**"|
|when something happened|"**one day**"**,** "**as soon as**"|
|how often|"**occasionally**"|
|your personal thoughts|"**annoyingly**"**,** "**surprisingly**"|

The meanings of some adverbs and adverbial phrases can be quite confusing and counterintuitive.  
  
Do you know what the differences between these pairs are?

- üëâ "**hard**" ¬†or "**hardly**".
- üëâ "**late**" or "**lately**".
- üëâ ¬†"**near**" or "**nearly**"
- üëâ "**currently**" or "**actually**"
- üëâ ¬†"**in the end**" or "**at the end**"

**Currently** : Actualmente.

**Almost** : Casi

**Nearly** : Casi, cerca de, casi en.

You've **worked hard** and as usual, **at the end of the lesson** let's quickly recap the most important points.  
  
Have a look at the notes below, just in case **you've nearly forgotten** the differences between these adverbs and adverbial phrases. üòâ

|  Verb |  Sentence |
|---|---|
|**hard**|with a lot of effort|
|**hardly**|almost never|
|**late**|not on time|
|**lately**|recently|
|**near**|close|
|**nearly**|almost|
|**currently**|at the moment|
|**actually**|in fact|
|**in the end**|finally|
|**at the end**|during the end|

Generally, we can use the **past perfect** ("I had studied") and the **past perfect continuous** ("I had been studying") to talk about events that occurred before another time or event in the past.  
  
However, if you want to distinguish between a past action that was in progress leading up to another past action, you can use the **past perfect continuous** tense to show this.  
  
You can also use this tense to emphasise the duration of a past event.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**They'd been hiking** **all day when** **they reached the summit.**|A past action was in progress leading up to another past action.|
|**We'd been working hard on the project** **for over a month**|A past action was in progress for a duration of time.|

**The summit** : La cumbre.

**Time stamps** : Marcas de tiempo.

**Managing** : Gestionado.

**Made them a trend** : Los convirti√≥ en tendencia.

**Had Paul been taking care of his back before the accident?** : ¬øSe hab√≠a estado cuidando Paul la espalda antes del accidente?

**The ground was still wet as it had been raining throughout the night**. :  El suelo a√∫n estaba h√∫medo, ya que hab√≠a estado lloviendo durante toda la noche.

**Throughout** : En todo.

**Had been going** : Hab√≠a estado yendo.

>***Had Been*** : Hab√≠a estado/sido.

In this lesson, we're going to read some creative writing and we'll focus on how verbs interact with each other.

Sometimes they just don't react and are happily next to each other **without** any **change** like in "**I should leave as soon as possible**". However, that's the case mainly for modal verbs (verbs such as "**should**", "**can**", "**must**", "**might**" or "**will**".)  
  
Here are two ways that verbs interact:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|adding "-ing" to the second verb|I recommend **ordering** a cheese board|
|adding "to" before the second verb in the infinitive|I want **to take** a course on creative writing.|

**She pretended not to see me.** : Fingi√≥ no verme.

**to appear to** : Parecer.

**Can't afford to** : No poder permitirse.

**To promise to** :  Prometer.

If you're looking for a pattern to figure out what verbs make the second verb take "-ing" or "to" + infinitive, you'll be disappointed to learn there are no rules - these verbs need to be learned. üò∞  
  
But hey, it's not all bad news as you've already learned quite a lot of them. üëçüèΩ

| Before then  |  Before then |
|---|---|
|"-ing"|''to'' + infinitive|
|imagine  <br>regret  <br>enjoy  <br>risk  <br>consider  <br>recommend|manage  <br>pretend  <br>promise  <br>appear  <br>can('t) afford  <br>appear  <br>want  <br>tend  <br>fail|

If you're using more than one adjective in a sentence, you have to place them in the correct order.  
  
There are **eight categories** to take into account üò±, but the good news is that you're very unlikely to use eight adjectives at once in a sentence.

| Order | Adjective   |
|---|---|
|1. **opinion**|a **beautiful** table|
|2. **size**|a **small** table|
|3. **age**|an **antique** table|
|4. **shape**|a **round** table|
|5. **colour**|a **black** table|
|6. **origin**|an **Italian** table|
|7. **material**|a **wooden** table|
|8. **purpose**|a **coffee** table|

| Oder   | Adjective  |
|---|---|
|1. opinion|**expensive** shoes|
|2. size|**small** shoes|
|3. shape|**flat** shoes|
|4. age|**new** shoes|
|5. colour|**brown** shoes|
|6. origin|**Italian** shoes|
|7. material|**leather** shoes|
|8. purpose|**walking** shoes|

**Leather** : Cuero.
