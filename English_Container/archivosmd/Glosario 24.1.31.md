If you want to use a reporting verb (_said, claimed, reported_) in the passive voice, we can start with the word "it" and use this structure:  
  
It + **to be** + reporting verb (past participle) + that + sentence  
  
Have a look at the examples below.

- It **is** said that a lack of protein can lead to hair loss.
- It **was** claimed that the divorce settlement exceeded $10 million.
- It **has** **been** reported that 80% of students miss online learning.

**Stated** : Declar√≥

**Estimated** : Estimado.

**Copycat** : Imitaciones

**Either before or after the sentence.** : Ya se antes o despu√©s de la oraci√≥n.

---
When we want to state exactly what someone's said, must use quotaton marks, like this ‚Üí " "  
We can include a reporting phrase (a person's name + a reporting verb) either **before** or **after** the sentence.

-  Mr Tang **responded, "**That would be frightening.**"
- "The Vice President is resigning"**,** her publicist has **announced**.

**Jog your memory with** : Refresque su memoria con}

The word "**just**" has various meanings, and in the video the director uses it frequently as an adverb (it comes **before a verb**).  
  
It doesn't change the significance of what he is saying, but it has a similar meaning to "simply".

We use **modal verbs** (words like "must", "might", "could") to express necessity, possibility or probability.  
  
We can use modal verbs to talk about **how sure** we are that something is true or not, and make deductions about the past and present.

- **must** - indicates certainty (+)
- **can't** - indicates certainty (-)
- **could**, **might**, **may** - indicates possibility, but with some doubt


---

When we want to make deductions about past events, we use the following construction:

"**can't/must/might/could**" + "**have**" + **past participle** ("failed", "hacked", "lost")

- My payment **must have failed** = _I'm sure that my payment failed._
- They **might have hacked** his account. = _It's possible that they hacked his account._
- She **can't have lost** her card. = _I'm sure that she hasn't lost her card._

**Have forgotten** : Han olvidado.

---
We've learned about expressing certainty and possibility about **present** and **past** events. Let's quickly review the constructions, before we practise making deductions ourselves!

| Present Event  | Past Event |  What express? |
|---|---|---|
|Joseph **could be** online now.|Joseph **could have been** online last night.|_expresses possibility about Joseph's activity online_|
|The store **must close** at midnight.|The store **must have closed** at midnight.|_expresses certainty about the closing time of the online store_|
|She **must not be able** to pay on the app.|She **must not have been able** to pay on the app.|_expresses certainty about app payment options_|

**That's odd** : Qu√© raro.

---
When speaking, we often merge the **modal verb** and "**have**" together to create "**must've**", "**could've**", "**might've**". We put more emphasis on the modal verb, which is why we produce the weak form of "**have**" when speaking. üó£Ô∏è

- I **might've** accidentally suspended my online banking account.
- You **must've** typed the details incorrectly.
- Someone **could've** hacked the account.
