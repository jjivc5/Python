Time, place and people in reported speech

When we tell others about something someone said or did, we might change the way we talk about **time, place and people**. It's like adjusting the details so the story makes sense from our point of view.

To talk about **past events** in reported speech, you can decide to keep the past simple tense ("she sold") or change it to the past perfect ("she'd sold").

Reported speech is often omitted in **informal spoken conversations**. Instead, you can hear "**she was like**" / "**she went**" to report somebody else's words.  
  
Both forms are used with direct speech so you **don't** have to **change tenses** or references to people, places and times.

| Reference to Person |  Example |
|---|---|
|I/she/he **was like**...|She was like, "I don't get why you don't respond to my texts".|
|I/she/he **went**...|And I went, "What are you talking about?"|
## El mensaje que no pude mandar

**I kinda like** : Me gusta.

Confident English speakers often blend words together when speaking or writing in casual situations.

|  Verb | Sentence   |
|---|---|
|**going + to**|I'm **gonna** try Ethiopian food for the first time.|
|**want + to**|I really **wanna** master French cuisine.|
|**kind + of**|I **kinda** like Indian food, but only if it's not too spicy.|

The word "like" is used a lot in conversation by native speakers. It's often used in a similar way to "well..." or "er..." and doesn't actually mean anything in this context.

| Example  | |
|---|-|
|I, **like**, didn't wanna be rude, so I ate the sushi, even though I really, **like**, hate it.| | 
|Do you, **like**, melt the sugar, or just heat it a little bit?| |
