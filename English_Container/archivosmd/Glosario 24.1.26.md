We use the passive when we want to focus on who **receives** the action, not who **does** the action.  
  
We often see the passive in academic or scientific writing. 九꽲잺

| Example   | Type|
|---|---|
|游뾇릖 People **know** the Danes for their happiness.|_**active**_ _- focus on who ("people") does an action ("to know")_|
|游뾇릖 The Danes **are known** for their happiness.|_**passive**_ _- focus on who ("the Danes") receives an action ("to be known")_|

We use the verb "**to be**" plus the **past participle** of the verb.

|  Example | |
|---|- |
|Hygge **is practised** all over the world.||

We change the tense of "**to be**" depending on whether we're talking about the past, the present or the future.  
  
In this lesson, we will practise the following tenses:

|**Tense**|**Active**|**Passive**|
|---|---|---|
|**Present simple**|"People all over the world practise hygge."|"Hygge is practised all over the world."
|**Present perfect**|"He has written many books about hygge."|"Many books have been written about hygge."|
|**Past simple**|"She invited them to a dinner party."|"They were invited to a dinner party."|
**Which** : ***QUE! QUE! ES*

**Burn**, past participle, **can be** *Burned, Burnt*

**I was given a book about hygge.** : Me regalaron un libro sobre el "hygge".

## Parte 4

**Sleeping mask** : Antifaz para dormir

  
We often use "**because**" and "**since**" to introduce the **cause** of another action or event (the **effect**).

| Sentence |   |
|---|---|
|**Since** I started running (_cause_), I've been feeling more healthy. (_effect_)||
|I can go on holiday (_effect_), **because** I've saved money. (_cause_)||
